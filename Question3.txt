Q3.
A.What is reverse-i-search in a Linux terminal?
The reverse-i-search is used for the history navigation. As, we forget the command which we used few days back, 
here one way is that we can use arrow keys but it will took us to each and every command we executed. 
But using reverse-i-search and giving any part of the command which we remind will took us to that command. All in all it is used for checking history.  


B.How do you list out the hidden directories using Linux command line tool?
By using ls command we can list all the directories but we can't list hidden directories by ls command.
So, we will use ls -a which will lists all the file with hidden directories.


C.How comfortable are you with using Linux-based OS like Ubuntu, Centos, etc?
I have knowledge of Ubuntu as I have worked in Ubuntu at my college but Centos is new for me. I will be comfortable with Linux based OS, 
if I got the chance to work with these I can work with dedication using my knowledge and research.


D.Have you ever used Servers to host any web applications in the past? If yes, what
services did you set up (Like- Apache/Nginx/FTP/SMTP, etc)?
No, not yet but used Xampp Control pannel where I use Apache and Tomcat as servers while working with the data to retrieve at the back end of the website.
